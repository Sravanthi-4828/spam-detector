This repository contains the code and resources for our final year major project:
"An Ensemble Learning Approach for Robust Spam Detection Using Big Data Analytics"

#Objective: To build a scalable and robust spam detection system that efficiently processes large volumes of email/text data using Apache Spark and ensemble machine learning algorithms to accurately classify messages as spam or ham.

Tech Stack:
Apache Spark (PySpark)
Python (Scikit-learn, NLTK, Pandas)
Big Data Integration (Spark for parallel processing)
Machine Learning: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVC, Decision Tree
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud
Website Integration (Optional): Flask + React
Dashboard (Optional): Tableau or Power BI
